# ChatGPT extensions for Emacs

## Overview

gptx is built to make AI-assisted code work feel fast, reliable, and safe.
It integrates tightly with gptel to give you repo-scoped chat sessions and a
shared, searchable log buffer so conversations and outputs stay organized by
project. Commands are intentionally simple and predictable: they are
region-aware and will operate on the active region or the whole buffer when
no region is selected (see `gptx-act-on-buffer-when-no-region'). Mutating
operations produce clean unified diffs and non-mutating operations preserve
your code while logging full responsesâ€”helping you iterate confidently and
keep an auditable trail of changes.

## Features (random order, not complete)

* Repo-scoped chat session buffer per project.
* A number of commands for reviewing, explaining, asking about, changing,
  improving, documenting, testing, debugging, and troubleshooting code.
  See below.
* Non-mutating commands leave code unchanged and log the full response.
* Mutating commands rewrite in place and log a unified diff.

## Installation

* Install the gptel package
* Put gptx.el in your load-path
* Get OpenAI API key from https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys
* Put OpenAI API key in ~/.authinfo: `machine api.openai.com login apikey password sk-****`

## Commands

### Non-mutating

* `gptx-review`
    Review code. Focus on correctness and risk.
* `gptx-explain`
    Explain intent, flow, invariants, complexity, and edge cases.
* `gptx-ask`
    Answer a free-form question about the code with minimal snippets.
* `gptx-write-unit-tests`
    Generate focused unit tests and a compact test plan.
* `gptx-debug-code`
    Produce a concrete debugging plan with optional tiny diffs.
* `gptx-troubleshoot-code`
    Identify likely failure points and fixes by inspection.

### Mutating

* `gptx-change`
    Rewrite region or buffer in place. Logs a unified diff.
* `gptx-improve-code`
    Improve code quality without changing public behavior.
* `gptx-document-code`
    Insert idiomatic documentation comments and docstrings only.
